Here are 5 array drills in C to help you practice and improve your understanding:

---

### **Drill 1: Sum and Average of an Array**
Write a program that:
1. Reads an array of integers from the user (up to 10 elements).
2. Calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the array.
3. Calculates and prints the average of the array.

**Input Example:**
```
Enter 5 elements: 10 20 30 40 50
```

**Output Example:**
```
Sum: 150
Average: 30.00
```

### **Drill 2: Find Maximum and Minimum**
Write a program that:
1. Reads an array of integers from the user (up to 10 elements).
2. Finds and prints the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

**Input Example:**
```
Enter 5 elements: 8 3 15 1 10
```

**Output Example:**
```
Maximum: 15
Minimum: 1
```

### **Drill 3: Reverse an Array**
Write a program that:
1. Reads an array of integers from the user (up to 10 elements).
2. Prints the array in reverse order.

**Input Example:**
```
Enter 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output Example:**
```
Reversed array: 5 4 3 2 1
```

### **Drill 4: Count Occurrences of an Element**
Write a program that:
1. Reads an array of integers from the user (up to 10 elements).
2. Reads a number from the user to search for.
3. Counts and prints how many times the number occurs in the array.

**Input Example:**
```
Enter 6 elements: 1 3 3 4 3 5
Enter the number to search: 3
```

**Output Example:**
```
The number 3 occurs 3 times.
```

### **Drill 5: Merge and Sort Two Arrays**
Write a program that:
1. Reads two arrays of integers from the user (up to 5 elements each).
2. Merges the two arrays into a single array.
3. Sorts the merged array in ascending order.
4. Prints the sorted merged array.

**Input Example:**
```
Enter 5 elements for array 1: 8 3 1 6 2
Enter 5 elements for array 2: 7 4 9 0 5
```

**Output Example:**
```
Merged and sorted array: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
